			<title>Sonic &amp; SEGA All-Stars Racing</title>
			<synopsis>Take part in a frantic battle to the checkered flag with Sonic and friends!

In a frantic battle to the checkered flag, Sonic and friends speed around tracks set in medieval castle ramparts, lush rainforests and bustling cities, all taken from the visually rich and varied universes of Sonic and SEGA. Fan favorites such as Dr. Eggman, Tails, AiAi, Amigo and many more will join Sonic in their custom built vehicles, revving their engines and jostling to stay ahead of the pack. Each character will speed around the track in cars, planes, motorbikes, and in Aiai&#8217;s case &#8211; a banana mobile! Secret short cuts, swift handling and avoiding strategically placed obstacles are certainly the best way to get to the top of the podium.

But winning is only part of the fun in Sonic &amp; SEGA All-Stars Racing! Each character has a specific All Star move &#8211; such as Super Sonic, Banana Blitz and Tails Tornado &#8211; that allows a quick way for competitors to get back into the race! Power ups and weapons can also be collected around the tracks and used against the opposition to ensure they don&#8217;t become a threat to that number one position.

Battle it out in single or multiplayer mode, allowing up to four friends to race in frantic split-screen action, or up to eight players to compete online in the ultimate racing showdown.

Can Amigo scramble Eggman? Will AiAi say bye-bye to Tails? Are you gonna be faster than Sonic? The race will start in 2010&#8230;</synopsis>

			<synopsis>Endless Ocean: Blue World builds on the ocean experience first introduced with Endless Ocean&#8482;. While the last game emphasized relaxation, this one is designed with more adventure in mind. Divers might find themselves escaping from or calming down attacking sharks, exploring shipwrecks or finding treasure. Endless Ocean: Blue World also has more creatures and improved graphics designed to fully immerse players in an ocean environment that they can freely explore at their own pace.

* Players dive into oceans all around the world to discover the fish, mammals and various sea creatures unique to each region while learning about their habits and behaviors. By selling salvageable items for money, players can buy decorations for their island and buy coral to attact new kinds of fish to their own private reef
* The ocean is teeming with life. Hundreds of real-life species are there to be discovered, from seahorses to giant whales.
* Are the local fish sick or agitated? Players can view their health status and then use a tranquilizer-like tool to zap the ones in need of rehab with healing energy.
* The game also includes a storyline that players can follow as they choose. The plot involves Oceana, a woman who investigates the &#8220;Dragon&#8217;s Song,&#8221; which her father, a prominent ocean explorer, was searching for just before his death.
* While at Nine Ball Island, players can become friends with a dolphin and teach it some new tricks. When on a dive, players can even bring along the dolphin, which players can hold onto for extra fast swimming.</synopsis>

The game features a robust multiplayer mode&#8212;up to four players can battle locally, or they can go online in each specific sales territory for one-on-one matches. **Kickin' Wii Controls! - Building on the frantic fun of Super Mario Strikers, this game gets you into action only possible on the Wii. Primary game play controls use both the Wii Remote and Nunchuck controllers. Use the Nunchuk to control your characters and deploy items. Flick the Wii Remote to perform the defensive "Big Hit" move and flatten foes. To defend against a "Mega Strike" goal attempt, use the Wii Remote to point at the screen and manually defend against multiple balls as they rocket towards the screen!</synopsis>

			<title>FIFA Soccer 10</title>
			<synopsis>Listening to feedback and addressing gamer frustrations has become a key part of the EA SPORTS strategy to improve the FIFA franchise on an annual basis.

Better balance on lofted through balls, improved goalkeeper intelligence, more realistic shooting mechanics with less shots hitting the goal posts, a practice arena to perfect skills, and a more immersive football experience through continuous play and quick free kicks are just a few of the issues raised by fans and addressed in FIFA 10. 

Three new innovations revealed today have been developed to change the player control experience in FIFA 10. The first-ever true 360&#176; dribbling system gives players finer control of the ball, enabling them to find spaces between defenders that previously were not possible. Using an all-new animation technology, skilled dribblers now have the ability to face the defender and use highly responsive lateral dribbling to skip past him. An innovative concept called Freedom in Physical Play enables players to perform wider dribble touches and new collision sharing creates a varied, less predictable, and extended fight for possession between the dribbler and a defender.

FIFA 10 also features a deeper iteration of the ever-popular Manager Mode with more than 50 major improvements, including new match realism, realistic player transfers based on multiple decision points, and true-to-life player growth curves.</synopsis>

			<synopsis>When it comes to music and rhythm games, Wii Music stands in a class of its own. Unlike other music games, which penalize players if they don't play perfectly, Wii Music is a musical playground where there are no mistakes. Here anyone can pick up and master the huge array of instruments available, through simple motions like strumming and drumming. Musicians in your band jam by simply playing their instruments to the beat of a song or by improvising to their heart's content. Play faster. Play slower. Skip a beat, or throw in 10 more. No matter what you do, Wii Music automatically transforms your improv stylings into great music.</synopsis>

General Herman and Brigadier Betty of the Western Frontier are on garrison duty in the Solar Empire when the Anglos strike, and assist Empress Lei-Qo and Admiral A-Qira in repelling the invaders. But as the nations of the world, including the Tundran Territories, are once again propelled into all-out conflict, it becomes clear that a shadowy figure is pulling the strings from afar.

			<title>FIFA Soccer 08</title>
			<synopsis>Play FIFA Soccer 08 to take your favorite team and players to Cup glory. Mesmerize defenders with authentic individual skill and play like a real soccer player. Now you pass, shoot, and perform trick moves all with a flick of the wrist. Dictate the play with all-new controls for through-passing and crossing, or control your goalkeeper in one-on-one situations to deny an onrushing striker.

FIFA Soccer 08 delivers complete authenticity with licenses for all of the world&#8217;s top leagues, including MLS and Mexican 1st Division in North America, and 28 others from more than 20 nations. This year you can choose to play with one of over 570 licensed teams and more than 14,000 players to win glory with or against up to three of your friends.

One minigame makes a rhythm game out of the familiar keep-the-ball-in-the-air drill. When the ball drops into a target circle, flick your Remote in the direction shown by the arrow.

Other minigames include Foosball, with unlockable tables, and a shoot-out in which multiple players can bombard one poor goalie. The low scorer becomes the keeper in the next round. Both the shoot-out and rhythm minigames will have plenty of power-ups.

All three minigames give you the option of playing with a Nunchuk or, if you don&#8217;t have enough to go around, the Remote only. By tracking winds, losses and even calories burned, the minigames will foster friendly intra-family rivalry. You can even unlock &#8220;Ronald-mii-nho,&#8221; the Mii version of Brazilian superstar (and FIFA cover athlete) Ronaldinho.</synopsis>

			<title>Endless Ocean</title>
			<synopsis>Endless Ocean is an underwater exploration through the pristine waters of fictional Manoa Lai Island. From the moment players experience their first dive, they&#8217;re introduced to a magnificent world of sun-pierced water, vibrant color, and flourishing sea life. With no time limits, point systems or possibility of failure, it&#8217;s a pick-up-and-play game for the entire family to enjoy. Intuitive controls and the game&#8217;s encouraging &#8220;explore at your own pace&#8221; approach create a momentary retreat.

The beauty of Endless Ocean is that players can do as much or as little as they like. The relaxed and calm atmosphere of the game gives divers the freedom to explore special locations such as shipwrecks and underwater ruins, discover and interact with sea-life, complete fish logs or simply relax in the soothing environment.

For players really looking to kick back and relax Endless Ocean features several soothing modes. On the deck of the boat is a deckchair that allows the player to sit and watch the sea. Alternatively in the aquarium section of the game players can select fish they have seen and add them in an aquarium for a closer inspection. What's more this game even doubles up as a tranquil screensaver if the Wii Remote is left untouched. The relaxed setting is further heightened with a tranquil soundtrack from New Zealand songstress Hayley Westenra.

If players prefer to dive with a buddy, the Wii's unique WiFi Connection Service allows players link up with their friends. By exchanging friend codes, two players may dive and explore the ocean together. In this co-op mode they have access to all the tools that can be used in single player mode, as well as an additional mode of communication controlled with the D-pad. With a fish logbook to complete, items to be salvaged and collected and the ability to listen to your own MP3's via the Wii SD Card slot while you dive, Endless Ocean provides hours of entertainment.</synopsis>

			<title>Super Mario Galaxy</title>
			<synopsis>Become Mario as he traverses gravity-bending galaxies, traveling in and out of gravitational fields by blasting from planet to planet. Players experience dizzying perspective shifts as they run upside down through wild alien worlds that need to be seen to be believed. Whether you're surfing on a ray across an ocean in the clouds, rolling on a ball through a treacherous garden, or floating in a bubble over a poisonous swamp, there's no limit to the cosmic challenges you'll encounter! 
 
Shake it! Controlling Mario is as simple as can be with the Wii Remote and Nunchuk. Move Mario with the Control Stick and shake the Wii Remote to perform a spin move or cue Ring Stars that launch you to and from planetary objects. You can even point at bits of stardust to collect them or latch onto Beam Stars to blaze a magnetic trail through the heavens. 
 
Mario can run, tiptoe, jump, triple-jump, backflip, and long-jump, but what he'll do most is spin. By shaking the Wii Remote, players make Mario spin around with fists outstretched, allowing him to pummel enemies and cue Star Rings that launch him from planet to planet. 
 
He can also find plenty of power-ups: A Bee Mushroom turns him into Bee Mario, allowing him to fly for short periods of time and cling to honeycombs. A Boo Mushroom turns him into Boo Mario, allowing him to float and turn invisible to pass through mesh gates. 
 
He'll constantly collect bits of stardust&#8212;these can be fired at enemies using the B Button. A second player can even take on this role, using a second Wii Remote to stall enemies, fire stardust, or even sweep aside projectiles.</synopsis>

			<title>Super Smash Bros. Brawl</title>
			<synopsis>Welcome to a brawl for the ages, where anything can happen, anyone can show up and all bets are off. 
 
Game storyline: In multiplayer games, characters from all Nintendo universes meet up in Nintendo locales to duke it out. In the solo mode called "The Subspace Emissary," the world of Smash Bros. is invaded by an entity called the Ancient Minister and his army of creatures, called "The Primid." Normally, characters come alive in the world of Smash Bros. to do battle, then turn back into trophies when defeated. However, the Ancient Minister starts turning characters into trophies to harness their power, then detonates bombs that suck pieces of the world back into his realm of Subspace. Eventually, all the characters must work together to defeat the invading creatures from Subspace - this is accomplished by playing through side-scrolling levels. 
 
How to progress through the game: For multiplayer games, players pick characters, set rules and locations for where they want to play and then duke it out. In Solo Mode, characters play through a long, side-scrolling adventure, beating up enemies along the way as they watch short cinematics starring their favorite characters. 
 
Characters: Mario, Samus, Bowser, Donkey Kong, Solid Snake, Meta Knight, Kirby, Pikachu, Zero Suit Samus, Link, Zelda, Pit and Wario, to name just a few. Anyone and anything from a Nintendo universe could appear in this game in one form or another. 
 
Special powers/weapons/moves/features: Anything from a Nintendo game could conceivably be in this game, whether it's a musical score, an obscure item or a character that shows up to help the fighters. Super Smash Bros. Brawl is eminently customizable, so players can choose the frequency of items appearing, adjust musical scores and basically play the game however they'd like. Items range from baseball bats to proximity mines to Pok&#233; Balls to Assist Trophies, which spawn characters like Hammer Bros. and Sim City's Dr. Wright to attack others.</synopsis>

			<title>Wii Sports</title>
			<synopsis>Bundled with Wii, Wii Sports introduces a whole new way to play your game. This is what video games should be: fun for everyone. Wii Sports offers five distinct sports experiences, each using the Wii Remote controller to provide a natural, intuitive and realistic feel. 

To play a Wii Sports game, all you need to do is pick up a controller and get ready for the pitch, serve or that right hook. If you've played any of these sports before, you're ready for fun!

Play Tennis, Baseball, Golf, Bowling and Boxing in the comfort of one's living room. No ball boys scurrying about, no oil from the alleys to get players dirty and no rain to keep anyone from a day at the court, park or course. Use the Wii Remote controller to mimic the actions of swinging a racket, bat or club, roll a ball down an alley or bring the left jab.

Players can use their own Mii caricatures in the game and play them against their friends' Miis for a more personalized experience. As players improve, their Miis' skill levels will increase, so that they can see exactly how much better they've become.

People of all skill levels can pick up and play any of the games in the unprecedented Wii Sports package, making this truly a title for everyone!</synopsis>

			<title>Animal Crossing: City Folk</title>
			<synopsis>If life were an endless vacation, what would you do? Go fishing, collect shells or watch fireworks with friends? Build a snowman, exchange presents with family or decorate your house for the holidays? Take a trip to the city, go on a shopping spree or visit friends from all over the globe? 

In Animal Crossing: City Folk, life moves at a relaxed pace, but the world brims with endless possibilities.

&#8226; There&#8217;s always something new to do. In the living, breathing world of Animal Crossing: City Folk, days and seasons pass in real time, so there&#8217;s always something to discover. Catch fireflies in the summer, go trick-or-treating on Halloween or hunt for eggs on Bunny Day. If you&#8217;re in the mood for something a little faster paced, take a bus to a new urban city area that&#8217;s unique to Animal Crossing: City Folk. There you can catch a show at the theater or check out the sales at Gracie&#8217;s boutique. But if you don&#8217;t show your face back home for too long, your neighbors will miss you.

&#8226; Up to four people from your household can live and work together to build the perfect town. Design clothes and patterns, write letters and post messages on the bulletin board for each other, or invite up to three friends to visit your town using Nintendo wifi Connection. With the new WiiSpeak microphone, it&#8217;s like you&#8217;re all in the same room. The microphone sits atop the sensor bar and picks up the conversation of everyone in the room to encourage a more inclusive experience.

&#8226; Get to know your neighbors. The heart of Animal Crossing: City Folk is building relationships with the animals in your town as well as with other players. Befriend your animal neighbors by exchanging letters, gifts and favors. Animals can also move from town to town, bringing their memories and stories from their old towns with them. And since animals are notoriously loose-lipped, they spill all the juicy details.

&#8226; Express your personal style. Customize your town, your house and yourself by collecting bugs, fish, fossils, art, furniture, clothes and accessories. You can also go to the salon in the city to change your hairstyle and get a Mii makeover. Plus, if you design clothes in the tailor&#8217;s shop, animals will wear them and maybe even bring them to other towns.

			<title>Valhalla Knights: Eldar Saga</title>
			<synopsis>The lands of Eldar have long been known as the origin of chaos, a place where monsters and demons wreak havoc, indiscriminate in their madness. Legend tells of how the Spirit King, whose coming was heralded in by a meteor shower, gained control of the creatures and waged an unrelenting war upon civilization. Order and life were brought to the brink of destruction, but an alliance of the four races was able to drive them back and seal the evil. Centuries more have passed and once again the lands are slowly being overrun by the reemerging monsters. Without a known cause or even a united front to repel them, it would seem that this time, Eldar will fall. It is up to you to take up the forgotten mantle of the hero, reunite the races, confront the hordes of monsters and restore peace to the land.

Features:
* Multi-generational Storyline &#8211; The player starts off as a human that seeks to reconcile and rebuild old alliances with the dwarves, halflings, and elves. As the story progresses, the player can choose a character of any of the races, each with specific strengths and weaknesses that can be customized further.
* Fully Customizable Characters &#8211; With five basic job classes (fighter, mage, priest, thief, bard) and numerous advanced classes, each with their own specific skills and abilities, with weapons and equipment that change the appearance of each character, the customization options are almost limitless.
* Real-time Battles on the Field Map &#8211; Battles take place in real-time, and all enemies are visible on the field map with no random encounters. These foes may be fought or avoided as you see fit.
* Build Your Own Battle Party &#8211; Find the perfect combination of race and job class of your accompanying party member as you hire a mercenary from the local tavern.
* Online Multiplayer &#8211; Party up with a second player online to explore the land of Eldar together with co-op gameplay.</synopsis>

			<synopsis>Call of Duty: World at War changes the rules of engagement by redefining WWII gaming and thrusting players into one of the most tension-filled, unforgiving battles against a new ferocious enemy in the most dangerous and suspenseful action ever seen in WWII. Powered by Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare technology, Call of Duty: World at War brings an uncensored edge to combat, as soldiers face the most harrowing and climatic European and Pacific battles in which an enemy, who knows no surrender and no retreat, will fight to the last breath, unleashing an arsenal of lethal surprising tactics. Peril and danger lurk throughout the battlefield as players combat the unknown risk of the new chaos of battle. From the remains of Russia and the ruins of Berlin, to the beach and jungles of the deadly Pacific Theater, the volatile action takes on added depth as players employ new features that previously were only-available in multiplayer, including perks, rankings and online stats in up-to full four-player cooperative gameplay. New infantry and vehicle-based weapons, like the potent flamethrower, bring the battlefield ablaze.</synopsis>

			<title>Spectrobes: Origins</title>
			<synopsis>Disney Interactive Studios' original series that combines fossil excavation with a Pok&#233;mon-like RPG battle mechanic makes its Wii debut in Spectrobes: Origins. Gamers once again join protagonists Rallen and Jeena as they travel to exotic lands to excavate, train, and command a variety of elemental creatures known as Spectrobes. The baby Spectrobes must then be sent to an incubator so they can grow strong enough to help Rallen and Jeena battle the vicious "Krawl" creatures that have been terrorizing the galaxy.

Excavation takes on the form of a Trauma Center-esque mini-game where players use their Wii Remote and Nunchuk to carve, blast, and chip the fossilized creatures out of their rocky encasements, with quicker and more precise cuts resulting in more powerful Spectrobes. Gamers can then enlist juvenile Spectrobes to help locate hidden items and fossils, while the "Adult" and "Evolved Form" Spectrobes hone their battle skills by engaging in real-time combat. Rallen and Jeena can bring as many as six Spectrobes with them into combat, while multiplayer fans can join a friend (in the form of a Spectrobe) for co-op battles.</synopsis>

			<synopsis>Leon Kennedy and Claire Redfield fight the undead in this thrilling co-op arcade shooter that relives classic moments from Resident Evil 2 and more, only for Wii.
Capcom brings the Resident Evil series back to Wii with the sequel to the highly successful, million-selling title, Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles, Resident Evil: The Darkside Chronicles.

Unlike the evil enemies you fought against in the previous story, in Resident Evil: The Darkside Chronicles, players will fight against the characters&#8217; own inner demons. Two of the most popular characters in the series and heroes of the beloved Resident Evil 2, Leon Kennedy and Claire Redfield, will be making their return. As unconventional heroes, the two start out the game as ordinary individuals who are thrown into terrorizing situations where their own fear is their biggest enemy. Featuring a brand new storyline that will fill in missing pieces of the &#8220;Chronicles&#8221; series, Resident Evil: The Darkside Chronicles leads players into a horrific world where the lines between good and evil are blurred and the fight begins with your dark side&#8230;

The game&#8217;s on-rail, arcade shooter gameplay first featured in Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles has been radically upgraded in Resident Evil: The Darkside Chronicles. One of the major additions is a sub-screen which will allow for weapon configuration and use of recovery items regardless of time progression. A horde of new features including a new system that allows players to modify the difficulty level according to their playing skills will bring accessibility and fun to both the hardcore and casual gamer.

Continuing in the survival horror tradition, Resident Evil: The Darkside Chronicles will increase the thrills and chills with an enhanced two-player co-op mode where players will be able to follow their partners on the same screen. Their conversations and interactions have also been improved to create a more intense co-op experience.

A more terrifying experience than ever before, Resident Evil: The Darkside Chronicles combines a shaky and realistic handheld camera experience with an eerie soundtrack and creepy sound effects utilizing state-of-the-art technology.

Features

&#8226; Two-Player Co-op Shooting: Invite friends and family to experience the horror alongside you in 2-player co-op mode.
&#8226; Revisit Classic RE Levels: Experience environments and areas from classic Resident Evil titles such as Raccoon City from Resident Evil 2 and the hidden Umbrella laboratory from Resident Evil: Code Veronica, as well as scenarios that will be all new to Darkside Chronicles.
&#8226; Fan Favorite Characters Return: Play as Leon S. Kennedy, protagonist of Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil 4, his partner Claire Redfield, who appeared in Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil: Code Veronica, and others still to be announced.
&#8226; Customizable Weapons: Players can upgrade and customize their weapons for each battle scenario. Each playable character can be specialized for a specific combat style.
&#8226; Dynamic Difficulty: In addition to the initial settings of Easy, Normal and Hard, the game&#8217;s difficulty level will adjust automatically based on the player&#8217;s skill level so that both old and new fans can have a fun and challenging experience.
&#8226; Collectibles Galore: For true Resident Evil devotees, archive items such as characters, enemies, old documents and movies can be found throughout the game.</synopsis>

			<synopsis>Black Ops is a first-person shooter. The player assumes the role of a foot soldier and thus has access to various firearms, of which two at a time can be carried, as well as explosives such as grenades and other equipment to fight enemies. When players are close enough to an enemy, they can perform a melee attack which ensures a one-hit-kill.

A character can be positioned in one of the three stances: standing, crouching, or prone; each affecting the character's rate of movement, accuracy, and stealth. The player can directly dive prone from a standing position. The player can momentarily run faster before getting tired. When the character has taken damage, the screen glows red. Health regenerates by avoiding damage. When the character is within the blast radius of a live grenade, a marker indicates the direction of the grenade, helping the player to either flee or throw it back.

The game features a variety weapons such as crossbows (with alternative explosive ammunition), Dragon's Breath rounds and ballistic knives.</synopsis>

			<title>Greg Hastings Paintball 2</title>
			<synopsis>Greg Hastings Paintball 2 introduces more than 10 single and multiplayer game modes each staged in all-new, paintball locations based on actual fields around the world. Seven single-player game modes challenge the most experienced "ballers" to hone their skills and then test them against up to 19 others in seven different multiplayer game types. Whether playing alone or against others, Greg Hastings Paintball 2 ups the ante with game-changing weather conditions and field hazards including rain, wind and fog. The game also features an improved map editor along with the hottest new gear and weapons. When things are at their bleakest, players can even use the all-new cheat meter that lets them avoid elimination by successfully wiping away paint splatter before they're caught.

Serious "ballers" can even become general manager of their own 10-player team composed of more than 100 professional and amateur paintball players. Gamers can trade players, issue commands, and use their earnings from the field to build each player's individual stats, so the overall team is that much more competitive. The better the team assembled, the more tournaments a player stands to win, providing him with added cash to buy new gear, players and skill upgrades.

			<synopsis>NFL Training Camp is a fitness program that combines arcade-style drills designed by NFL strength and conditioning coaches with wireless motion tracking, a resistance band, and heart rate monitor. More than 70 drills and challenges are included in total, with the goal of improving one's strength, conditioning, agility, first-step quickness, and other skills. With the wireless motion tracking system, sensors in the included leg and arm straps will complement the Wii Remote to offer a more complete body monitoring system while offering full range of movement.

Your heart rate will also appear on the screen in real time, giving you an idea of the intensity of your workout for maximum calorie burning. Thanks to the NFL license, you'll be able to pick a professional team and train alongside your favorite players at their home stadium. Connect to the game's website to track or share your fitness data, which is automatically uploaded for those with active online connections. Once you've got the basics down, you can attempt the NFL Combine 60-Day Challenge, which features progressively challenging activities inspired by authentic preseason drills. ~ Scott Alan Marriott, All Game Guide</synopsis>

			<title>Wii Sports + Wii Sports Resort</title>
			<synopsis>Wii Sports Resort:
Wii Sports Resort takes the inclusive, fun and intuitive controls of the original Wii Sports to the next level, introducing a whole new set of entertaining and physically immersive activities. With the deep control enhancements of Wii MotionPlus, veteran Wii users and newcomers alike can enjoy unprecedented gaming precision as they cruise on a water scooter, duel with swords, throw a Frisbee&#174; and much more. This sequel to the popular Wii Sports makes use of the Wii MotionPlus accessory, which gives players the most responsive and realistic experience possible. The Wii MotionPlus accessory, which is included with Wii Sports Resort, plugs into the base of the Wii Remote&#8482; controller and, combined with the accelerometer and sensor bar, provides an experience that gives players an even greater sense of immersion. Just as with Wii Sports, people will love competing against friends and family. As the competition heats up, Wii Sports Resort is as much fun to watch as it is to play. First-time players will find it easy to pick up a Wii Remote and jump into the action.
Wii Sports:
Wii Sports introduces a whole new way to play your game. This is what video games should be: fun for everyone. Wii Sports offers five distinct sports experiences, each using the Wii Remote controller to provide a natural, intuitive and realistic feel. 
To play a Wii Sports game, all you need to do is pick up a controller and get ready for the pitch, serve or that right hook. If you've played any of these sports before, you're ready for fun!
Play Tennis, Baseball, Golf, Bowling and Boxing in the comfort of one's living room. No ball boys scurrying about, no oil from the alleys to get players dirty and no rain to keep anyone from a day at the court, park or course. Use the Wii Remote controller to mimic the actions of swinging a racket, bat or club, roll a ball down an alley or bring the left jab.
Players can use their own Mii caricatures in the game and play them against their friends' Miis for a more personalized experience. As players improve, their Miis' skill levels will increase, so that they can see exactly how much better they've become.
People of all skill levels can pick up and play any of the games in the unprecedented Wii Sports package, making this truly a title for everyone!</synopsis>

			<title>Raving Rabbids Party Collection</title>
			<synopsis>Rayman takes a back seat to the raving rabbids in this collection of Ubisoft's insane mini-game titles.

Making their first appearance in time for the Nintendo Wii's launch, the raving rabbids have quickly become the face of one of Ubisoft's most popular mini-game franchises. With their uncontrollable nature and psychotic personalities, the rabbids have gone on to front a whole host of titles. Rabbids Party Collection places their first three games into one package: Raving Rabbids, Raving Rabbids 2 and Raving Rabbids TV Party.

The first in the mini-game series, Rayman Raving Rabbids, keeps its focus on Ubisoft's iconic character, Rayman, as he works his way through a selection of over-the-top mini-games that utilize the Wii Remote, as well as a more story-driven adventure mode. Its sequels place further emphasis on the loveable rabbids themselves, providing less plot in favour of a more robust selection of insane mini-games. Over 175 mini-games are available across the three titles in total.

Rabbids Party Collection gives players a huge amount of mini-game content in one package, each featuring Ubisoft's weird and wonderful rabbid creations.</synopsis>

			<title>Tatsunoko vs. Capcom: Ultimate All-Stars</title>
			<synopsis>Tatsunoko vs. Capcom: Ultimate All-Stars is a 2.5D fighting game developed exclusively for the Wii console, in which players face each other with a team of two in a one-on-one fight to deplete their opponent's health bar. Tatsunoko vs. Capcom is a departure from the more complex attack systems implemented in the Street Fighter series and some previous Vs. fighting titles. The game was built around a simplified three-button attack system (Weak, Medium, Strong) since it was developed with the Wii in mind and an attribute of Vs. games is the ability to execute special moves with simple commands. There is also the multifunctional "Partner" button that can be used to tag in a teammate or provide assistance in attacking. The game's two largest and most powerful characters, Tatsunoko's Gold Lightan and Capcom's PTX-40A, fight on their own without a partner resulting in the inability to do universal techniques that require a partner. To regenerate health, each player may switch out their characters at any time. A team can perform two special moves simultaneously at the cost of three special bars. The match is over once one of the teams have no remaining fighters.

Tatsunoko vs. Capcom is the first Vs. series game to feature 3D graphics on a 2D plane creating a 2.5D environment consisting of character models and backgrounds rendered in 3D, while gameplay remains on a 2D plane used in traditional fighting games. The camera has freedom to move in 3D at certain times during fights, for dramatic effect. Additionally, most stages have a theme relating to a Tatsunoko franchise or a Capcom game and are mostly not interactive to the player.

Universal mechanics are similar to the previous Marvel vs. Capcom games. Characters can call their partner to do a predefined "Variable Assist" attack. Characters can tag with another character, performing an attack upon entry called a "Variable Attack". Performing a "Variable Counter" also lets the player tag out with another character. "Snapback" is an attack that forces the opponent to switch characters should it land. "Hyper Variable Combination" lets characters of one team perform their Hyper moves, attacks that require a stock of level, at the same time, whereas "Delayed Hyper Cancellation" cancels a current Hyper move of the character with another Hyper move of the character's partner. Each character has a launcher to send the opponent to the air, allowing the character to do an "Air Combo".

There are also new universal techniques found in the game. "Variable Aerial Rave" lets the character switch to his or her partner while in mid-air. "Mega Crash" is a defensive maneuver that frees the character from the opponent while sacrificing a part of his or her life and two stocks of levels. "Baroque Cancel" is a mode where the character glows in a rainbow of colors while sacrificing the red portion of the character's life - activating the mode cancels the current attack animation, allowing the player to extend combos and deal more damage relative to the amount of red life that is sacrificed. Baroque ends when the character stops or performs a Hyper move.

Tatsunoko vs. Capcom: Cross Generation of Heroes has an Arcade mode, which involves the player battling against computer controlled opponents in multiple stages until he or she reaches the boss character, Yami from &#332;kami. Time attack and Survival mode requires the player to defeat every character in the game. Survival limits health regeneration while Time attack is solely about completing it in the shortest time possible. There is a shop where unlockable characters, alternate character costumes, character profiles, movies, illustrations, background music for use in the gallery and minigames can be purchased with money obtained throughout the game. </synopsis>

With a single Wii Remote, you can raise fascinating creatures of all shapes and sizes, including deep sea fish and glowing jellyfish! 

Like the original, you can customise your aquarium, and choose which fish to put in and where to place various decorations. You can also choose from a variety of coloured lights to illuminate your aquarium. In time, your fish might breed to give you a whole new shoal to raise! Create your very own aquarium for endless hours of relaxing fun and entertainment! 

This sequel features a larger selection of fish and objects than the original! And like before, you can link up to the Forecast Channel to reflect the actual weather. You can send your aquariums to registered friends via WiiConnect24. What's more, Add-On Content will be available for later purchase. 

Come dive in and see all the wonderful creatures of the deep blue sea! </synopsis>

			<title>ThruSpace</title>
			<synopsis>ThruSpace is a unique 3D puzzle game that will put your spatial awareness and reaction times to the ultimate test. Steer a Keydron, a simple geometric shape, at high speed through gaps in a series of walls, rotating it to the correct angle to fit through: the more walls you pass through the more you score, plus, you can pick up crystals to boost your points. 

Once you've mastered the basics, learn how to do tricks and combos. Some gaps are bigger than the Keydron, but you can fill the entire space with the Keydron's shadow before passing through it, upping your score even further. 

There are three modes to enjoy - Normal, Endless and Trick Challenge - and you can save three of your best runs as replays to watch again in Keydron Memories mode. Plus, upload your scores to the online leaderboard and see how you stack up with players from across the world! </synopsis>

ARKANOID Plus! is an updated version of the original arcade blockbuster. Players must destroy colored blocks by guiding an Energy Ball around the screen using a spaceship called a VAUS. The game features a host of new modes and settings which radically alter the gameplay experience: "Arcade Mode" consists of 61 Rounds divided into left and right versions with two types of boss characters appearing in the last Round; "VS Mode" lets players face off against a friend or the CPU; and the unfailingly frantic "Time Mode" challenges players to clear Rounds within a strict time limit. Factor in the subtle differences arising from the choice of &#8220;Lives&#8221; or &#8220;Barrier&#8221; rules, along with a plethora of exciting items, and it&#8217;s clear you&#8217;re in for hours and hours of blockbusting fun!</synopsis>

			<synopsis>A tasty nibble of a game, it is bite-sized barbering at its finest, in only minutes a day.

The village residents are hungry for the latest in foliage fashion, and it&#8217;s up to you&#8212;the new barber&#8212;to fix them up. Use the tools of your trade: scissors, clippers, spray can, and more, in this humorous, first-of-its-kind &#8220;first-person-groomer&#8221; game.

Bonsai Barber features a colourful cast of twelve intriguing customers, including a temperamental shallot starlet (don't call her an onion!), an oddball strawberry boffin, a cactus cowboy, a daredevil carrot, and a suave banana with top-secret clearance.

Each day, five customers arrive to test your stylistic skill. If the customer requests a specific style, you'll plow that furrow, or you can rely on your expertise to pick from over thirty popular fashions... Or why not turn over a new leaf; be creative and see how they react!

They&#8217;re a demanding bunch, so if you miss an appointment, you&#8217;ll hear about it&#8212;on your Wii Message Board. But, if you do a good job, you may receive a gift or even a postcard from an exotic destination, as your happy customers travel to distant lands and show off their exquisite coifs.</synopsis>

			<synopsis>The suave star of Homestarrunner.com now has his own game series on WiiWare!

Strong Bad Episode 1

Charming. Suave. Awesome. These are the words Strong Bad would use to describe himself. In a world gone mad, only one man can be trusted to save the day. A man with an attitude. A man called Strong Bad.

As the star of the Homestar Runner web cartoons, Strong Bad has been answering emails (in boxing gloves), pranking his friends, pummeling his enemies, and making people with questionable taste snort milk out of their noses for years now. And he's branched out to star in Strong Bad&#8217;s Cool Game for Attractive People, a monthly 5-episode series.

In Episode 1: Homestar Ruiner, when Strong Bad's plans to beat the snot out of Homestar backfire, he ends up with an unwanted houseguest cramping his style. Now he needs to get life back to normal, by any means possible. But wait, there's more! Teen Girl Squad comics! Achievements! Funny costumes! Arcade games! You can even send pictures and emails to Wii friends using Strong Bad's computer! So how about it? Can you handle Strong Bad's style?</synopsis>

			<title>Crystal Defenders R2</title>
			<synopsis>In a land ruled by might and magic, peace is ensured by the benevolent power of the crystals.

In CRYSTAL DEFENDERS R2, you must deploy various units, such as Fencers and Black Mages, to stop waves of encroaching monsters from escaping the area with your party's crystals. There are many types of units to choose from: some specializing in powerful short-range attacks, some wielding far-reaching magicks, and still others equipped with bows, enabling them to bring down aerial foes. Deploy units in strategic locations to take full advantage of their traits. Each time an enemy breaches your defenses and reaches a map's exit, your party will lose crystals. When all your crystals are gone, the game is over. R2 offers several new, challenging maps containing multiple entrances and exits. It also introduces three varieties of Power Crystals, allowing you to enhance the abilities of your units, while new jobs, including Flintlock and Tinker, set the stage for even more complex strategies. Can you defend all the maps without losing a single crystal?</synopsis>

			<synopsis>Diner Dash&#174;, the number one PC Action Puzzle game has landed onto WiiWare! Guide Flo, an office-worker turned restauranteur, as she builds up her empire over four unique diners! Go online to face players in head to head matches! If you feel up to the challenge, join up with a friend or another player online for a Team Dash game where your team will take on six other players to see whose diner is the best in town!

Players take direct control of Flo as she runs around to seat patrons, take orders, deliver food, take payment and bus tables as efficiently as possible within the time limit allowed. Players fond of the traditional control schemes may also use a point-and-click style with hotkeys to aid Flo in her quest for customer satisfaction, which is reflected in a heart meter that empties as customers lose patience. If the meter empties completely, then the customer will leave the restaurant.</synopsis>

			<synopsis>Target Toss Pro: Lawn Darts is a new WiiWare game based on one of the nation's most infamous backyard games.
Target Toss Pro: Lawn Darts is a new WiiWare game based on one of the nation's most infamous backyard games. Target Toss Pro: Lawn Darts has four types of flying dart action to choose from: Classic Lawn Darts, 501, Cricket and Poker Darts. Each game has a unique scoring method and strategy to keep you entertained for hours. 

Classic Lawn Darts involves throwing three darts at two circles with an escalating Red Dot Bonus bull's eye in the center. 501 is similar to the classic pub darts game of the same name, and involves throwing three darts at a dartboard during eight rounds of play until all 501 points&#8212;and not one point more&#8212;are cleared. Cricket is another classic pub darts game of three tosses per round where players compete to close out the numbers 15 through 20 and the bull's eye before their opponent. Poker Darts involves launching five darts at a deck of 52 playing cards while attempting to get the best poker hand, and highest scores, over three hands.

			<synopsis>LONPOS is a simple yet challenging puzzle game that tests your logic and concentration, either by yourself or working with - or against - other players. The aim is to arrange differently-shaped pieces to fit inside a box by moving and rotating them with the Wii Remote so that all pieces are used.

In Normal Mode you battle the clock, solving puzzles as fast as you can to win points. Or take on Continuous Mode, where one false move means failure. In Cooperative Mode, take turns with a friend to complete puzzles, or try Versus Mode to battle with up to three opponents, either on the same Wii console or worldwide via Nintendo wifi Connection.

LONPOS comes with lots of puzzles to tax your grey matter - but if you hunger for more of a challenge, you can obtain even more puzzles, and also new backgrounds and visuals, via Nintendo wifi Connection Pay &amp; Play!</synopsis>

Their chosen fighting style is the ancient art of Banana Flinging and, now sworn enemies, this band of angry apes is each determined to outlast the other in a furious contest of fruity war.

Controlling one of eight monkeys you will do battle with the up to seven others across eight different themed landscapes.

			<title>Toki Tori</title>
			<synopsis>A brain teasing puzzle game with dozens of hours of gameplay!

Toki Tori is his name, and collecting eggs is his game! In this puzzle/platform game, players get to use a variety of items such as the Telewarp, InstantRock&#8482;, and Slug Sucker. Clever use and combination of these items is needed to solve all the game's levels, of which there are more than 70. These levels range from easy to brain-teasingly hard, resulting in dozens of hours of puzzle play time. Toki Tori makes the most out of what the Wii console has to offer. It uses the Wii Remote for a unique control scheme, which offers players a new and more relaxing play style. A second player can help you out by drawing hints while you are playing. The game even uses the Wii Message Board in a unique way! In short, Toki Tori is a puzzle/platform game, offers dozens of hours of game play, uses multiple Wii Remotes for a new play style, uses the Wii Message Board, and displays game and manual text in English.</synopsis>

			<title>My Zoo</title>
			<synopsis>Raise exotic animals in your very own zoo!

"My Zoo" is a relaxing animal sim that puts you in the shoes of an animal breeder, raising up animals you'd normally only dream of. All it takes is a Wii Remote controller for a simple, yet fulfilling connection with nature. There are 12 animal types in total (four sold separately as add-on content). Select your favorites and nurture them to adulthood. Feeding them, petting them, and cleaning up their messes is a great way to form a lasting bond. Each animal's personality will change depending on how you take care of them. Watch them get spoiled, turn into over-eaters, and more as they grow on a daily basis. Some animals will even have a baby on occasion, and once it's born, you've got another mouth to feed. Game time passes much more quickly than real time, and the different animal types are active at various hours--some during the day, and some at night. Sometimes it's fun to just kick back and watch what they do. So what are you waiting for? It's time to create your own personal zoo.</synopsis>

			<synopsis>Using WiiConnect24, you can download ghosts and send your ghost to friends. Also, you can get information about tournaments run through the Mario Kart Channel, as well as information about events.

If you install the Mario Kart Channel in your Wii Menu, you can access each of the channel&#8217;s features without having the Game Disc inserted. However, if you want to race, you will need to insert the Game Disc into the Wii.</synopsis>
