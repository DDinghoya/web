Happy 2025 everybody! Though we may have exited our busiest month, we haven't exactly been slacking off either! Let's take a look at what we did in January.
## New intro
Not exactly a huge headline to begin with, but it's certainly important! Now that we've entered a new era for WiiLink, a new intro seemed appropriate. Thank you for Alex for creating the intro, and Kolton for the sounds along with it.

## Pizza remastered
Do you live in the US or Canada? If you do, it's your lucky day (if you do, we swear we're working on JustEat)! Domino's ordering just got a whole lot better with Food Channel Domino's Version 1.0! The update is available now, with tons of updated translations, visual upgrades, future ordering and even a order tracker!

## Linking your Wii to the modern age
With the launch of Food Channel 1.0, we launched WiiLink Accounts, a brand new way to use WiiLink. The new system allows us to no longer rely on Discord accounts to use Food Channel, as long as providing further functionality in the future. We will never ask you to make an account for services that doesn't require them in the first place, but we have other things in mind that we're very excited to show you. Stay tuned.

## Reclaiming the legacy
Along with the other two launches, we upgraded our patcher to include more channels! The Today and Tomorrow Channel, Wii Speak Channel, Internet Channel and Photo Channel 1.1 are all now available on the new patcher, no longer requiring you to download the legacy patcher to install. Enjoy using the channels if you have yet to install them!

## The meaning of life, the universe and Digicam
Since we've launched Digicam in, uh, 2021 (has it really been that long??) we admittedly haven't done much with it. That may change though, since our lead developer Sketch has been toying with the channel and managed to figure out how to add new cards. This will mean in the future, we can provide new themed designs for business cards *without* having to delete the old ones, making it easy for us to make new designs and giving you more options.

## 200,000 views on Wii Room!
Moving over to the content side of things, we've managed to hit a mind boggling 200,000 total views on Wii Room! Thank you for all of you who keeps watching Wii Room and giving us a reason to keep creating original content for the channel. We have a lot planned for this year, and we can't wait to show it to you.
