## WiiLink
#### Information about the service itself.

Why WiiLink?

   > WiiLink is the only service to bring back Japanese exclusive Wii channels after they were officially shut down.
        We’ve made Wii no Ma and the Digicam Print Channel functional once more.
        We’re hard at work on the Demae Channel, letting you order food directly from your Wii.
    With our service, you can experience all of these once more on your Nintendo Wii - possibly for the first time.
    After our merger with RiiConnect24, we also offer the full suite of WiiConnect24 channels!

Why does WiiLink exist?

   > Without a replacement service for these Japanese and Streaming channels, they would be lost to time, never to be seen again. However, thanks to our work, future generations of players can experience these channels again!

Is using WiiLink legal?

   > Absolutely. We develop all of our channels without copyrighted code and material, and rely solely on what is provided within the channel and public knowledge. All code is written from the ground up. You will have no legal trouble from using our service.
