The WiiLink Bot is a Discord bot that's written in Java that allows you to look up error codes for Wiimmfi, WiiLink, or WiiLink WFC. It's powered by the <a href="https://wiimmfi.de/error/">error API from Wiimmfi</a>, and the WiiLink Violet API. You can also exchange codes with other users for the Wii (U), Switch, 3DS, and game-specific codes.

<a href="https://github.com/RiiConnect24-Bot/RC24-Bot">The source code for the WiiLink bot is on GitHub</a>. After you invite the bot to your server, you can find all the commands you can use by typing in `/help`in the chat. You can always invite the bot to your server by going to <a href="/bot">wiilink24.com/bot</a>.
