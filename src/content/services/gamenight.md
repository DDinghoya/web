## Play a Wii game on Wiimmfi and WiiLink WFC every week!

<br>

Every week in the WiiLink Discord server, we pick a Wii game to play on <a href="https://wiimmfi.de/">Wiimmfi</a> and <a href="https://wfc.wiilink24.com/">WiiLink WFC</a> with other Discord users every Saturday!
<br>
We like to play tons of games, both popular and obscure, and we encourage you to join in on the fun!
<br>

To participate in Game Nights, join the Discord server and select the "Participate in game nights" role within ther onboarding process, or in the "Channels & Roles" area!
