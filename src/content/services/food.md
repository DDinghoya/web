The Demae Channel was a Japan-exclusive Channel that allowed you to deliver food to your home
(sushi, chicken, pizza, hamburgers, etc). The service it used is <a href="https://demae-can.com/">Demae-Can</a>.
It was later released for the Wii U, but it was discontinued on March 31, 2017 for both the Wii and the Wii U.
