## Send content made in WarioWare DIY directly to your Wii!

<br>

DoujinSoft is the largest website for community made WarioWare DIY content! It has almost all of the content that was on Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection prior to its shutdown, and allows you view/play the content directly in your browser!


Using WiiLink's <a href="https://www.wiilink24.com/guide/board/">Wii Mail (Wii Message Board)</a> service, a <a href="https://wiimmfi.de/patcher/wiiware">Wiimmfi patched</a> version of WarioWare D.I.Y Showcase, and the WiiLink DNS, you can send any content from the website directly to your copy of the game.
