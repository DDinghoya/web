        <div class="subsection">
          <h3>Service Description</h3>
          <p>
            Food Channel JustEat is an unofficial, fan-made modification of a Wii Channel application that
            lets you order food via JustEat from your Wii console. It is not
            affiliated with Nintendo or JustEat and is provided "as is" without
            any sponsorship or endorsement. Nintendo and JustEat retain all
            rights to their names and services. By using Food Channel and its
            web-based pay system (which uses PayPal for payments), you
            agree to these terms. Use of the service is at your sole risk, and
            we make no warranties or guarantees about its operation or the
            results it provides. Your use of the Service is at your sole risk.
            The Service is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis
            without any warranty or condition. You must read and agree to all
            terms before using the service.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="subsection">
          <h3>Eligibility</h3>
          <p>
            You must be at least 16 years old to use this service. If you are
            between 16 and 18, you must have parental supervision and consent
            while using the service. Persons under 13 are not allowed to use it
            at all (consistent with WiiLink policy). By registering, you confirm
            that you meet the age requirements and that any information you
            provide is accurate.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="subsection">
          <h3>Account Registration</h3>
          <p>
            To use Food Channel JustEat you must create a persistent user account (via
            WiiLink). You agree to provide accurate and complete information
            when registering. This includes your name, valid email, and any other required details. You
            are responsible for keeping your account password and credentials
            secure; we will not be liable for any loss or damage if you fail to
            safeguard your account. You may not use the service for any illegal
            purpose or violate any laws in your jurisdiction. We reserve the
            right to refuse service, suspend or terminate accounts at our
            discretion if you violate any terms.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="subsection">
          <h3>Ordering and Payment</h3>
          <p>
            Food Channel allows you to browse local restaurants and place orders
            through JustEat's network. You are responsible for verifying that
            all order details (items, quantities, special instructions) and your
            delivery location are entered correctly. All orders are submitted
            through our web interface and paid via PayPal. We do not process or
            store your financial details – only a payment token (reference from
            PayPal) is used to complete the transaction. Once your payment is
            authorized by PayPal, the order is sent to the restaurant. All sales
            are final once payment is made. By confirming an order and payment,
            you enter a binding contract with the restaurant to supply the food.
            We do not guarantee availability of any item or honor of any offer
            on the menus.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="subsection">
          <h3>Delivery</h3>
          <p>
            Restaurants or couriers arrange delivery. We do not coordinate
            the order nor control delivery performance. Delivery times
            are estimates only, and delays can occur. We expressly disclaim any
            responsibility for late, lost, damaged, or spoiled orders. Any
            delivery time is an estimate, and we assume no responsibility for
            any losses resulting from delays or errors in order delivery. Once
            an order is delivered, we are no longer responsible for the order.
            We will not be responsible for the Order (including the quality or
            safety of the contents) after delivering the Order.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you are not present or provide incorrect address details, or the
            restaurant fails to deliver, these are risks you assume. We
            encourage you to provide clear instructions and be available. Any
            issue with the delivered items (missing items, quality complaints)
            must be resolved directly with the restaurant or courier. We have no
            control over the restaurant's food quality or preparation practices,
            and we disclaim all liability for it. An intermediary service does
            not guarantee in any way the quality of any delivered products…
            despite our efforts we cannot guarantee that the menu or services
            offered… perfectly match what is presented.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="subsection">
          <h3>Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability</h3>
          <p>
            We are not liable for any indirect,
            incidental, special, or consequential damages arising from your use
            of the service or inability to use it. This includes, but is not
            limited to, lost profits, loss of data, loss of enjoyment, or any
            issues stemming from order problems or account issues. For instance,
            if you get charged and your food doesn't arrive, we are not
            responsible – your remedy is with the restaurant or delivery
            service. We do not guarantee that any errors in the service will be
            corrected, that the service will be uninterrupted, or that it is
            secure. We expressly disclaim all warranties, whether express,
            implied or statutory, including merchantability and fitness for a
            particular purpose.
          </p>

          <p>
            We are also not responsible for damages to your Wii console or
            network arising from using any Wii homebrew or third-party code.
            WiiLink is NOT responsible for any possible damages that may occur
            to your Wii Console as a result of the use and installation of
            WiiLink Content. By using Food Channel (which runs through WiiLink),
            you agree that any modifications to your Wii are at your own risk
            and Nintendo's terms still apply.
          </p>

          <p>
            We also disclaim responsibility for any action taken by JustEat or
            Nintendo against your account. Using a fan-made channel may violate
            JustEat's terms of service, potentially leading to account
            restrictions or bans. We are not liable for any such bans or
            restrictions. Likewise, we do not guarantee compatibility with
            future updates of the Wii or Nintendo's network services. Use this
            service as a convenience, at your own risk.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="subsection">
          <h3>Intellectual Property and Third Parties</h3>
          <p>
            All content (menus, images, trademarks) belongs to the restaurants
            and JustEat. We act merely as an intermediary. We do not own, sell
            or produce any food. We are not responsible for third-party content
            or policies. Any links or references to third-party sites (including
            PayPal and Discord) are provided as-is; we do not endorse them. You
            agree not to upload any illegal or infringing material in any
            user-driven part of our service.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="subsection">
          <h3>Termination</h3>
          <p>
            We reserve the right to modify or discontinue the service at any
            time without notice. We may suspend or terminate your access if you
            violate the terms. You may also close your account at any time via
            the WiiLink interface; doing so will end this agreement.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="subsection">
          <h3>Governing Law</h3>
          <p>
            These terms are governed by the laws of Canada (WiiLink's home
            jurisdiction). Any disputes will be subject to Canadian law.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="subsection">
          <h3>Support and Contact</h3>
          <p>
            If you encounter issues or want to request help, support is provided
            only via our Discord or email. You agree that we have no obligation
            to provide support, and any assistance is provided on a case-by-case
            basis. Contacting our Discord "support" channel is the primary way
            to reach us. Do not expect phone support or guaranteed response
            times. For any inquiries (including appeals about account issues or
            delivery problems), please use the Discord or the support email
            listed there.
